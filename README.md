# @unovis/dagre-layout - Graph layout for JavaScript

Dagre is a JavaScript library that makes it easy to lay out directed graphs on the client-side.

For more details, including examples and configuration options, please see the [wiki](https://github.com/dagrejs/dagre/wiki).

    ℹ️ This version of Graphlibrary is a fork of https://github.com/tylingsoft/dagre-layout,
    which is a fork of the original `dagre` package (https://github.com/dagrejs/dagre).

    We've created this fork to update the code to ES modules and use individual lodash imports
    to allow better tree shaking in Unovis.
